CMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
  No project() command is present.  The top-level CMakeLists.txt file must
  contain a literal, direct call to the project() command.  Add a line of
  code such as

    project(ProjectName)

  near the top of the file, but after cmake_minimum_required().

  CMake is pretending there is a "project(Project)" command on the first
  line.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:21 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindLibConfig.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "LibConfig", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "LibConfig" with
  any of the following names:

    LibConfigConfig.cmake
    libconfig-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "LibConfig" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "LibConfig_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "LibConfig" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.


CMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
  No cmake_minimum_required command is present.  A line of code such as

    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)

  should be added at the top of the file.  The version specified may be lower
  if you wish to support older CMake versions for this project.  For more
  information run "cmake --help-policy CMP0000".
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
